Description: 
This package contains implementations of the K-means clustering algorithm and  
Multiclass Logistic Regression, developed as part of a collaborative assignment.  
The package leverages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo for computational efficiency,  
with wrappers to connect C++ implementations to R.  
It supports basic clustering and classification tasks, aimed at practicing the  
translation of R algorithms into efficient C++ code.
